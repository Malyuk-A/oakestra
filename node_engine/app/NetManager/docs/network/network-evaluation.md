# Evaluation of EdgeIO networking capabilities 

## Aspects that can be tested 

* Troughput
	* Example: Toward Highly Scalable Load Balancing in Kubernetes Clusters [3], **Evaluation And discussion section**
* Balancing  
	* Balancing of the cpu load
		* Example: The Design of Multi-Metric Load Balancer for Kubernetes [4], **experiment and results section**
* Bandwidth 
	* Example: Networking Analysis and Performance Comparison of Kubernetes CNI Plugins [5],  **Test Results section**
* Fault tolerance
	* Example: Scalability evaluation of VPN technologies for secure container networking [6], **section IV and V**   

## Setup 

* Service to Service communication 
	* Same node
	* Different nodes
	* Different clusters (if possible)
* Client to Service communication
	* Direct communication
	* Rerouted communication
* Service to Client 
* Services communication during migration
* Services communication during scaling up 

## Simulating the network

The network setups that we can physically manage are not many. In order to have a wide range of tested environments, as part of the network development, several scenarios must be tested. The use of network simulators is highly recommended. 

A list of configurable networking simulators is available in the article Hogie et al. **An Overview of MANETs Simulation** [1].
This article, even if it's quite old, can be a good starting point with the due precautions. In fact for instance the network simulator ns-2 is presented even if now exists ns-3. 


A comparison of a few networking simulators (NS-2, NS-3, and OMNet) in terms of architecture and performance has been done in  **Evaluating network test scenarios for network simulators systems** [2]

Suggestion: Let's start with our own networking environment and let's use a network simulator for more complex environment later on.
